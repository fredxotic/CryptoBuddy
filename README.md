- **`DataClient`** - Robust CoinGecko API client with caching and retries
- **`CoinRegistry`** - Symbol/ID resolution system
- **`CryptoPersonality`** - Meme-loving response generator

## 📊 Analysis Methodology

### Sustainability Scoring (0-100%)

```python
# Heuristic based on consensus mechanism
- Proof-of-Stake detected: 80-100%
- Proof-of-Work detected: 20-30%
- Foundation/non-profit signals: +15%
- Default/unknown: 50%
```

### Risk Assessment (0-1.0)

```python
# Multi-factor risk scoring
- Price volatility (24h change magnitude): 50%
- Market cap size: 30% 
- Liquidity (volume/market cap): 20%
```

### Combined Scoring

```python
# Balanced recommendation algorithm
combined_score = (
    sustainability * 0.4 + 
    (price_momentum / 100.0) * 0.3 - 
    risk * 0.3
)
```
